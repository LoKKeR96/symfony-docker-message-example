# Symfony Docker Message Example

This repository is a demo project where I demonstrate how to develop some RESTful APIs in PHP using
a framework called Symfony. Here I'm trying to replicate what I've developed in the repo `microservice-example`.

This project is very basic, there is a Message entity and some RESTful APIs in the `MessageController` controller
to create, get and update messages.

There is no authentication, just a simple project to get familiarised with Symfony.

This project is using a template for a dockerised Symfony repo that can be found at https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker
